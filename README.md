## MDS207 Statistics for Data Science

### [brfss_2000.csv](https://www.openintro.org/book/statdata/?data=cdc)

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual telephone survey of 350,000 people in the United States collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As its name implies, the BRFSS is designed to identify risk factors in the adult population and report emerging health trends. For example, respondents are asked about their diet and weekly physical activity, their HIV/AIDS status, possible tobacco use, and even their level of healthcare coverage. The [BRFSS Web site](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/) contains a complete description of the survey, the questions that were asked and even research results that have been derived from the data.

This data set is a random sample of 20,000 people from the BRFSS survey conducted in 2000. While there are over 200 questions or variables in this dataset, this data set only includes 9 variables.

Body girth measurements and skeletal diameter measurements, as well as age, weight, height and gender, are given for 507 physically active individuals - 247 men and 260 women. These data can be used to provide statistics students practice in the art of data analysis. Such analyses range from simple descriptive displays to more complicated multivariate analyses such as multiple regression and discriminant analysis.

### [ames.csv](https://www.openintro.org/book/statdata/index.php?data=ames)

All residential home sales in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010.

### [breast_cancer_wisconsin.csv](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)

Diagnostic Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~street/images/.

### [us_census_income_data_clean.csv](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/20/census+income)
